When you die, your body ceases to function, and all biological processes come to an end. The heart stops beating, breathing halts, and the brain's activity flatlines. This marks the transition from life to death, as consciousness fades and the body begins the process of decomposition. Your physical remains will return to the earth, contributing to the cycle of life in nature.

SAY GOODBYE TO SPRING.
